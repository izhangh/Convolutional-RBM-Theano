This package contains functionality to extract redundant
DNA sequence features from a set of provided sequences.
The package also contains utilities for plotting the revealed
motifs and conducting clustering analysis based
on the revealed motifs.


A comprehensive documatentation, including a tutorial
on how to use the package can be found here:
